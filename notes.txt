  SpaceOperaRb - has a raphael hexmap and minimal schema that paints forests and hills

                 configured for gsap
  SpaceOperaBk3 - has react-hex-map and a minimal schema
  discourse - for diplomacy

  OldImperial - rails composer and devise but not much to it
  tabletop - a rails constructor project, with a good minimal schema, trying devise
  hexmap - just a minimal schema
  lemonade-stand and tokafish-poker - just good examples of statemachines and play
  turnstyles, turnstyles admin - aurelia experiment and admin experiment - can discard

-----------------------------------
The Plan
-----------------------------------
Take OldImperial, the kendo version
Populate the region names for sahul
Construct a story post meteor drop that eliminates most of the past to simplify data entry
Create 2 database schemas
  a minimal one to test the process that just is used to tie paths to region names in sahul
  do one projection of this resource for Admin, Dei, Position, Public
  a complete one that is a current as possible with lessons learned to date

Add the chronicles, the position/finances, leader actions, rules and history
as the five main things with tabs on the right

The chronincle view has links to names of positions people and places

The map tool has regions, areas in Layers, Markers and Dragable Movement
leaders left click to drag, right click to choose actions

Add the flex interface for realm actions and finances as the third tab

We may have a second admin view to add dialogs from
spawn, scrivener and cartographer for data entry

Do a new design document with these ideas bringing things together

The ability to bring in maps to the story with different views and details
Processing and writing tools for the GM with the ability to add clip art to stories

I pick up the story from where it left off and licence the Game World from Thom
Phase 2 can be surviving the deluge of the moonfall meteor showers
Phase 3 will be going into space with small teams on ships to waypoint crucible
